# Burger App

### Project Description

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Deployed

A working version of the app is on [heroku](https://lit-scrubland-47107.herokuapp.com/)
