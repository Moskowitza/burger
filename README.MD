# Burger App

### Project Description

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

### Deployed

A working version of the app is on [heroku](https://lit-scrubland-47107.herokuapp.com/)

### Short Tour

![screenshot](https://github.com/Moskowitza/burger/blob/master/ImageReadMe/screenShot.png)

The app has 3 sections

* A burger menu, with buttons to move them to your order list
* Burgers To Eat are the ones you would like to eat
* A section to add new burgers to the Menu OR straight to the Burgers to Eat list


### Not In This Version
Commented out code would has code to allow
* Delete burgers out of the database all together
* Move burgers back to the menu list
* Display the index {{!-- {{@index}} --}} position of the burger in the database

## YUM
enjoy
